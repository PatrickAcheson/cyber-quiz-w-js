# cyber-quiz-w-js
A quiz I created with knowledge gaining from a CSS, HTML and JS course.

**07/05/2022**

<h2>About The Project</h2>
I had been working through a full-stack course on Udemy, due to the course being partly outdated I only learned as far as front-end development. I used my basic/intermediate skills in CSS, and HTML to create it, although I aim to expand into the backend at some point.

After the initial design, I used Javascript to create browser-side quiz script that pulls questions from an array.

I attempted to create a leaderboard system that saved the final score into a JSON client-side file and used that to update the leaderboard. This is currently broken and I will attempt to make it work properly in future commits.

**# Known Issues & bugs**
**
- score counter scripts counts before adding
- leaderboard has issues and will not display from the JSON file
- spelling errors in a few questions**
