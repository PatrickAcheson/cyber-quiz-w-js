# cyber-quiz-w-js
A quiz I created with knowledge gaining from a CSS, HTML and JS course.


**07/05/2022**

**# Functionality**
I had been working through a full-stack course on Udemy, due to the course being partly outdated I onyl went as far as front end development. I haved my basic/intermediate skills in CSS, HTML to create it.

After the initial design, I used Javascipt to create browser side quiz script that pulls questions from a array.

I attempted to create a leaderboard system that saved the final score into a JSON client side file and used that to update the leaderboard. This is currently broken and I will attempt to make it work properly in future commits.

**# Known Issues & bugs**
**
- score counter scipts counts before adding
- leaderboard has issues and will not display from JSON file
- spelling errors in a few qustions**
